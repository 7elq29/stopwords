# Default English Stop Words from Different Sources:

Stopword filtering is a common step in preprocessing text for various purposes. This is a list of several different stopword lists extracted from various search engines, libraries, and articles. There's surprisingly little agreement between different lists.

At the moment it's just English stopwords.

Therefore, they can be ignored in the context of full text searching. For example, every English text contains words like a and the, so it is useless to store them in an index. However, stop words do affect the positions in tsvector, which in turn affect ranking.

Notes:
* File format: 1 word per line. Unix newlines `\n`, end with a blank line. utf8 encoded.
* Case & Punctuation was preserved as presented, except when all UPPERCASE - these were lowercased.
* Where multiple versions of lists exist in code, the latest stable version was used.
* Exact duplicates included for reference (eg: MongoDB). Linked to the file i found first.
* Source URL is where the word list came from. Sometimes listed words do not match what's in the software.
* Description is how the page, help manuals, or code comments describe stopwords.
* There are way too many blogposts and pages that list or collect stopwords - only a small sample is listed here.
* [generate_table.py](generate_table.py) makes the table above from en_stopwords.csv
